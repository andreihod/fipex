# Fipex

Fipex is a wrapper to crawl the [Fipe](https://veiculos.fipe.org.br/) website just like a API.

## Installation

Since it's not published in the Hex repo yet, you need to add this repo to your list of dependencies
at `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:fipex, git: "https://github.com/andreihod/fipex"}
  ]
end
```

## To-do

* Documenting
* Publish at Hex
